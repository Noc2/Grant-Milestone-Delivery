## General Notes

1. In your documentation [here](https://liberland-1.gitbook.io/wiki/v/public-documents/blockchain/for-developers-and-testers/testing_guide), you are including link to google doc, instead of having the information available on the wiki. Consolidate your documentation in one place so you have one source of truth. 

2. In your Testing Guide, you are including some keys together with the mnemonics used to derive the keys. Make sure you keep all key information interally and preferably private, even if you are using for testing accounts. 

3. Docker image works. It seems we can run your node in --dev mode and from chain-spec. Maybe you can include this in your documentation.

###  Concluding Remarks

#### Remarks by @JosephKnecht-lab


Based on my evaluation, you have not provided all the deliverables as described in you application. Thus I have to reject this delivery. My advise is to update your initial application with the exact deliverables that you are delivering for this milestone, before it can be accepted. 

Furthermore, a lot of your pallets are derivative work from already existing pallets (such as registry, nfts) and I would expect more original work for grant submission. 

Note that this evaluation is not binding since I do not work of Web3 Foundation, so the Web3 team can accept your delivery in its current state.

## Testing Guide Feedback

- testing instructions can found in the [gitbook](https://liberland-1.gitbook.io/wiki/v/public-documents/blockchain/for-developers-and-testers/dev#run-automated-tests)
- ~~however, running the node failed with an "cannot deserialize module: UnknownOpcode(192)" error on my machine~~ the node can be run successfully:
