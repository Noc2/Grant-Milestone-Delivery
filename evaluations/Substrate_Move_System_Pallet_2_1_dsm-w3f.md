## Evaluation V2

### Documentation

The links are working now.

### Pallet-move

I was able to run the `cargo clippy` command. No warnings.

```
user@localhost:~/Documents/movevm/pallet-move$ cargo clippy --all-targets
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.56s

```

### Docker

I was able to start the node, but I couldn't connect the `polkadot.js`. I tried to use `ws://127.0.0.1:9944` and `ws://0.0.0.0:9944`, and with wss also didn't connect. I think probably is some configuration in the container. This don't prevent the milestone approval, but It would be nice to fix. 

## Evaluation V1

### Documentation

The two links in the [pallet-move README in the section move-example](https://github.com/eigerco/pallet-move/blob/main/README.md#move-example) are pointing to inexistents files.

### Docker

I received this error when running the docker.

```

```

### Pallet-move

All tests on this repository passed with good coverage. The `src/lib.rs` has 82% of coverage.

I received this error when running the `cargo clippy`

```

```

I received some warnings when running the `cargo fmt`. It doesn't seem to be a problem.

I was able to run the benchmark for the pallet-move.

I was able to follow [the tutorial](https://github.com/eigerco/pallet-move/blob/main/doc/tutorial.md) without problems.

The tutorial gives the example of code [CarWash.move](https://github.com/eigerco/pallet-move/blob/main/tests/assets/move-projects/car-wash-example/sources/CarWash.move) and shows how to use the [pallet-move](https://github.com/eigerco/pallet-move) on the substrate and how to use [smove](https://github.com/eigerco/smove) to build, estimate the optimal amount of gas and create script transactions.

### Substrate Move

All testes in [Substrate Move](https://github.com/eigerco/substrate-move) are passing.

The move-vm-backend and move-vm-backend-common have good coverage of close to 80%. The Language could have better coverage in some parts, but I think it's good in general.
