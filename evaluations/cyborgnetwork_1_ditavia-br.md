## Evaluation V4

### Testing 

We tested the hosted version. We needed to enable Insecure content on the browser to work.


![unnamed(1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25a55f91-f6cf-4e27-b635-27de2f31b23d)


![unnamed(2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cddc9067-4d58-43fb-8043-993a73e823c5)


We registered the worker without a problem, but we weren't able to assign the task to the worker because the system was assigning it to another one. However, we viewed the worker was connected with the system because it generated some logs.

![unnamed(3)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4354aac9-52af-49e8-bd7d-bbf823e5ccba)


![unnamed(4)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e261bfb-bbab-4281-9eba-bb7d41983fa5)


We also tried to test hosting all on the same network. We didn't have a Mac to use the UTM to create virtual machines. Instead, we used Azure to host three machines.

- Parachain and Frontend.
- K3s Master node.
- K3s Worker node.

We were able to use it like on the hosted version.

### Documentation

The documentation needs minor changes. We don't think it is necessary to hold the project because of that.

- Some instructions on the [INSTRUCTIONS.md](https://github.com/Cyborg-Network/cyborg-parachain/blob/6ba9720eb4f4d8c187282be53abdc077512a8a95/INSTRUCTIONS.md) have the command to change the branch to `updated-parachain` the master branch is more updated now and it works fine.

- On "Option C: Fully Local Setup with UTM and Local Parachain" change the instructions to start the Master Node to the pm2 commands. We checked it, and it didn't work if you use the `MasterSetup.sh`

- Add the image Docker image URL to the [worker-logs example](https://github.com/Cyborg-Network/cyborg-parachain/blob/6ba9720eb4f4d8c187282be53abdc077512a8a95/INSTRUCTIONS.md#worker-logs).

- On the [instructions to install the Cyborg-connect](https://github.com/Cyborg-Network/cyborg-connect/tree/f5d5c3430f828f91dcdb118cd6f3cc4c819c05d2?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) is missing the "clone" on the git clone command.

## Evaluation V3

### Testing

We set up the master-node and the worker-node using the Azura Virtual Machine as recomended. 



Master-node VM

![image (61)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/129aaa66-f9ee-40e4-85d4-8e6b7a1d3f83)




Worker-node VM

![image (62)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc8b0eae-9b74-4001-a9d9-0229af00ec50)




This time, the node was showing corret:

```
ditavia@cyborg1:~/cyborg/Worker$ kubectl get nodes
NAME        	STATUS   ROLES              	AGE   VERSION
k3s-master-01   Ready	control-plane,master   21h   v1.30.3+k3s1
worker-one  	Ready	<none>             	31s   v1.30.3+k3s1
```

We send the request

```
curl -X POST http://172.174.200.217:3000/deploy \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"imageUrl": "hello-world"}'
```

Received the response:

```
{"message":"Deployment dynamic-deployment-0em6ht and Service created","nodePort":"31086"}
```

Master-node Log:

```
stdout: deployment.apps/dynamic-deployment-0em6ht created
service/dynamic-deployment-0em6ht-service created
stderr: 
```

We notice the pallet edge-connect isn't available in any of the three chains on the extrinsics.

So we have done this on the [hosted chain](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://fraa-flashbox-3239-rpc.a.stagenet.tanssi.network#/extrinsics). I registered the node. The image shows the node registered.


![image (63)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b10fb5b9-fa8b-49af-bc54-d3319a07d6c0)


We tested different versions of the front on the branch main, parachain-update (it was indicated to use this branch before, but now the guide doesn't specify a branch to test), and the hosted version. We used the hosted node because the local node hasn't finished the deployment. We need to test it locally to ensure the functionality. The hosted node registered the task but didn't return anything about the task on the logs like on the second evaluation.

Image showing the console log when we tried to use the local node.

Image showing the console log on the front end (parachain-update). There seems to be some connection problem with the worker. No additional logs were generated on the Master-node or the frontend terminal. Using the branch main I received a similar log.

![image (68)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dec56b10-94eb-4277-bd8c-ac901b544f30)


We also noticed some instructions on the guide saying to use one function of the pallet, but the print uses another.

## Evaluation V2

### Documentation

The testing guide improved, adding more details on how to set up the system and use the pallets. We tested the pallets, but we had some problems with the K3s. 

### Pallets

We tested the pallets `workerCluster` and `taskManagement`.

Image showing the cluster registration and the creation of the task schedule.

### K3s

We had some trouble to set up the K3s system. We ran the script `MasterSetup.sh` to run the cluster on port 3000, and we ran the script `WorkerSetup.sh` in another machine, but when we tried to verify the master node and the worker node running, we didn't get the expected results. 

```

The connection to the server 127.0.0.1:6443 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?
```

We also tried to specify the host and port to verify, pointing to the process running on port 3000:

```
ditavia@localhost:~/Documents/w3f/cyborg/Worker$ kubectl get nodes -s 192.168.0.35:3000

```

### Frontend

The front end on the branch `parachain-updates` has some problems:

![unnamed(3)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa20fe24-0b6e-491d-93de-0c27cd88a768)


We returned to the `main` branch to check this problem. It only occurs when using the `parachain-updates` branch. We didn't get this problem again when we changed back to the branch `parachain-updates`. We could replicate this problem by cloning the repository again.

We tried to test using the hosted chain. We registered the public IP:

![unnamed(4)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48140fff-2947-4983-afc2-3fa77404e7ff)


Uploaded the `hello-world` example, but the dashboard showed an error for that task:

![unnamed(5)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0656f99-5676-4f9b-96fd-be734bc7d7ae)

We checked the events on the chain to confirm if the chain got the task:

![unnamed(6)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9f7b090-a53c-4ed9-9f8e-edcacf1103b0)

We checked on the Chain state of this task:

## Evaluation V1

### Documentation

We noticed that the "Link" column on the deliverables table is missing. Please add this column with the appropriate links. 

The [parachain repository](https://github.com/Cyborg-Network/cyborg-parachain/tree/9685a55711b2e1ec63fdbc6603965e7b3784f8d6) is missing the instructions to use the docker to setup the chains. Ideally, the docker should set up all the systems, not only the chains.

The [parachain repository](https://github.com/Cyborg-Network/cyborg-parachain/tree/9685a55711b2e1ec63fdbc6603965e7b3784f8d6) should have the instructions to run the tests.

### Test

We couldn't set up all the systems to test locally. We were able to run the chains using the Zumbinet and the front end without problems, but we couldn't successfully run the Worker.

We were able to save the `k3s-node-token.txt` and use the command `node KubeServiceNodePort.js` using the script provided:

```
ditavia@localhost:~/Documents/w3f/Worker$ sh MasterSetup.sh
The k3s node token has been saved to ./k3s-node-token.txt. Use this token to connect worker nodes to the cluster.
Updated Server listening on port 3000
```

We couldn't use the command below successfully. Could you explain better how to use it or give some examples?

```
sh WorkerSetup.sh <worker-name> <master-ip> <token>
```

We tried to use the front end but it was stuck on this part of the process:

![Captura de tela de 2024-07-30 10-42-03](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddde7fb3-c22e-4dbe-a78d-d24e6e7a9be5)

We tried to test the hosted version to check it but we don't know what is the chain connected to get some balance.

![unnamed (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abb5f427-7754-4276-a245-b9f2b4517524)


One question, can we use the polkadot.js extension as the wallet to confirm the transaction? Because this only appeared when using the talismã wallet.

We executed the tests on the [parachain repository](https://github.com/Cyborg-Network/cyborg-parachain/tree/9685a55711b2e1ec63fdbc6603965e7b3784f8d6) to check the pallet functionality. One test was ignored, and all the other tests passed.

We also ran the command `cargo tarpaulin` to check the test coverage for the pallets. It could be better for the pallet edge-connect, but the improvement isn't mandatory.

### Code Quality

We ran the command `npm run eslint:check` for the repository [cyborg-connect](https://github.com/Cyborg-Network/cyborg-connect/tree/b5f123c4b9d4af210f6343bddb8311dac2b6787a), it returned some warnings. For example:

We also ran the command `cargo clippy` for the [parachain repository](https://github.com/Cyborg-Network/cyborg-parachain/tree/9685a55711b2e1ec63fdbc6603965e7b3784f8d6), it returned some warnings. For example:

```

The fix of these warnings isn't mandatory but would be nice to have.
