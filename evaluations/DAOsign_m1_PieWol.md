## General Notes
One of the major goals of the grant project by the w3f is to nurture development of innovative tech thats open source and easily reusable by anybody. 

In your Ink! contracts you used some code that doesn't seem to have any meaningful impact on the functionality. 
e.g.:

```
pub fn validate_signed_proof_of_agreement(&self, data: SignedProofOfAgreement) -> bool {
            assert!(data.proof_cid.len() == IPFS_CID_LENGTH, "Invalid proof CID");
            assert!(data.message.app == "daosign", "Invalid app name");
            }
```

Whats the reason to setup the contracts in this way? Are you trying to make sure that no other service uses the contracts you have deployed yourself? 

I would love to see those gatekeeping lines removed so others can use the code you wrote for the ink! contracts directly without modifying it or having to adapt their dApp towards these additional checks. 

I wonder why you added those in the first place. If somebody really wanted to they still could just construct their calls towards the contract in a way that it conforms with your additional logic for name checking. So I'm looking forward to your reply on this matter. 

## Article
I think your article currently has a very good introduction. You mention how the contract is mainly storing proofs but it's not clear to the reader how this enables the product you are creating as a whole. I see that you linked the github for technical details but I think main goal of the article is to explain to readers how you achieved your goal and which component plays what role in the context of the whole product. 

## Testing
