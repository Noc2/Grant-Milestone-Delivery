# General Notes

Great work overall. I am able to successfully run and test the node. Looking forward to seeing it come together in the next milestones.

Builds and runs successfully using:

`docker build -t subcoin-node --file ./Dockerfile .`
`docker run -d subcoin-node`

`ubuntu@ip-172-31-19-85:~/subcoin$ docker run -d subcoin-node
dca693f9a95cb5c850ad0ef9bc2bd93919ee360ef155bb0d3741834badb226c5`

Also directly from GH with `docker pull ghcr.io/subcoin-project/subcoin:v0.1.0`

Subcoin node executable correctly located at `target/production/subcoin`

`bitcoind` node runs successfully.
