# General Notes


In ``pallet-bitcoin`` you use the error message "txid must be encoded correctly; qed" both for encoding and decoding operations. I think it would be great it these error messages were unique for both operations. Furthermore it looks like the result type in the trait is used for a reason as the writer can emit errors. Whats the reason you put an `.expect()` here allowing for a panic? Basically, why are you sure that it will never happen? 

Are you planning to introduce more tests to vital modules? ``pallet-bitcoin`` currently only has one test to check on encoding. Unit tests should cover the logic you have implemented.

## Documentation

Some elements e.g. structs are still without inline doc. It would be great if this could be completed.

## Tests
All tests are passing. Some modules are without tests.

## Docker

Sadly I can't figure out how to start the node in docker. If I try to use `docker run <image_id> run` I get the following error. Any idea how I can make it work?
