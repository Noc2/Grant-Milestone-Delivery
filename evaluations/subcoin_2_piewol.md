# General Notes
 
I'm glad to hear that you are planning to further extend the testing of the node and runtime. Looking forward to it.

## Documentation

Initially a few items were missing documentation. Thanks for adding docs on those.

## Tests
All tests are passing.

## Docker
Image is building and running a container works as well. Specifically running the container as root solved initial issues. The node is running fine within Docker using the following command `docker run --user root subv2 run`.
