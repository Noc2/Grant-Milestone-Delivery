    Warning: patch-package detected a patch file version mismatch

    Don't worry! This is probably fine. The patch was still applied
    successfully. Here's the deets:

    Patch file created for

        @galacticcouncil/sdk@0.7.7

    applied to

        @galacticcouncil/sdk@1.1.1
    
    At path
    
        node_modules/@galacticcouncil/sdk

    This warning is just to give you a heads-up. There is a small chance of
    breakage even though the patch was applied successfully. Make sure the package
    still behaves like you expect (you wrote tests, right?) and then run

        patch-package @galacticcouncil/sdk

    to update the version in the patch file name and make this warning go away.

    Warning: patch-package detected a patch file version mismatch

    Don't worry! This is probably fine. The patch was still applied
    successfully. Here's the deets:

    Patch file created for

        @galacticcouncil/sdk@0.7.7

    applied to

        @galacticcouncil/sdk@1.1.1
    
    At path
    
        node_modules/@galacticcouncil/sdk

    This warning is just to give you a heads-up. There is a small chance of
    breakage even though the patch was applied successfully. Make sure the package
    still behaves like you expect (you wrote tests, right?) and then run

        patch-package @galacticcouncil/sdk

    to update the version in the patch file name and make this warning go away.
