| Number | Deliverable | Accepted | Evluation Notes |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **1.0a.** | Copyright and Licenses | CC BY 4.0 |
| **1.0b.** | Documentation/Tutorial | As we do not plan on delivering code we will not provide documentation in that sense. The delivered report at the end of this milestone will serve as documentation. |
| **1.0c.** | Methodology | This milestone will be achieved mainly by compiling and reading relevant literature as well as internal talks and discussions. We may involve interviews with external parties such as web3 researchers and/or wallet developers, specifally for Task 1.2. Our results can be verified through the report delivered in this milestone. |
| **1.0d.** | Infrastructure | We expect that all our work and deliverables for this milestone can be reviewed and understood without need for specific infrastructure or software except from a web browser. |
| **1.0e.** | Article | We will deliver a short report that contains a list of academic papers that we studied and a discussion on which cryptographic schemes are most suitable for our goal of building Threshold BIP32 wallets for Schnorr. The report will contain the results from Tasks 1.1 to 1.3. The report is mainly for internal use and hence will be approx. 2 pages. We will make sure that the report is easiliy accessible to the reviewers and the community. |
| **1.1.** | Investigation into threshold Schnorr protocols | We will investigate the current state of the art in threshold Schnorr protocols that are suitable to work with the Schnorrkel/Ristretto environment. We will evaluate them according to efficiency (round complexity, communication complexity) and security. For the latter, important criteria are: (1) static vs. adaptive corruption, (2) corruption threshold, (3) robustness, (4) cryptographic assumptions and models (e.g., only RO vs. AGM). |
| **1.2.** | Identification and prioritization of desirable features | We will research and discuss the priority and importance of specific efficiency and security features for our application (wallets). If necessary, we may involve interviews with external parties such as web3 researchers and/or wallet developers. |
| **1.3.** | TVRFs for threshold Schnorr wallets | We will investigate if existing protocols for TVRFs are compatible with the threshold Schnorr protocols from Task 1.1. We will classify them according to the criteria mentioned for Task 1.1. |
