## General Notes

### Mar 1

- `volume` changed to `weight`
- added unit and e2e tests

### Jan 31 

- I ignored the Docker deliverable, as it's unnecessary in this context.
- Only the buyer can finalize, so it's unclear how the `total` gets transferred in case that doesn't happen.
- `volume` is declared as `Grams`, so it's unclear how other units of measurement. Would each commodity have its own smart contract so that the unit is the same for all commodity contracts and different for each smart contract?
- Payments are made in fungible tokens that are created within the smart contract. Native token payments would be much more flexible.
