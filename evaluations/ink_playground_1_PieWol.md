## General Notes

## Documentation
Default ink!-playground readme and your additional documentation included there makes a good documentation for this project. Thanks for the final update on this matter.

## Ink! version upgrade via Github-action
Grantee has shown that in his own non-archived repo the github actions are executed as expected.
https://github.com/Zeeve-App/ink-playground/actions/runs/7897895698

## Ink! version selection in playground + url
The selection of the versions works and is also displayed in the url as requested in the issues you completed.
Especially referencing issues https://github.com/paritytech/ink-playground/issues/460
and https://github.com/paritytech/ink-playground/issues/427

## Summary
After the documentation update and showcase of github action I see this as accepted.
