## Evaluation V2

### Documentation

The instructions with problems in the documentation were fixed.

### App Example

All the examples are working.

### TEE Image build guide

The [Gramine Docker Image Build Example](https://github.com/wetee-dao/examples/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#2-gramine-docker-image-build) has a problem that will need a fix.

I successfully built the Docker image but when I tried to execute it I received a log showing this warning. The container exited, not showing the correct log.

```
azureuser@weteevm:~/examples/my-gramine-app$ docker build -t my-app .
DEPRECATED: The legacy builder is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

```

In the Evaluation V1, after I removed the `ADD app.manifest` from the Dockerfile, I was able to run this example and received the log below (only showing the final of the log), where I could see the "Hello, world!" message. This time, I received that warning. This problem don't prevent the acceptance of the milestone but would be nice to fix it.

## Evaluation V1

### TEE Image Build Guide

The examples for [Wetee TEE Image build guide](https://github.com/wetee-dao/examples/blob/main/README.md) have some problems. 

*   The [command](https://github.com/wetee-dao/examples/blob/main/README.md#12-add-golang-maingo) to build the `main.go` should be `ego-go build main.go`. 

*   I needed to change the version to 1.23 on the `go.mod` to build successfully.

    ```
    azureuser@weteevm:~/examples/my-ego-app$ ego-go build main.go
    go: errors parsing go.mod:
    /home/azureuser/examples/my-ego-app/go.mod:3: invalid go version '1.22.0': must match format 1.23
    ```

*   The `enclave.json` is searching for the executable hello. I needed to change this JSON to use the executable main.

    ```
    azureuser@weteevm:~/examples/my-ego-app$ ego sign
    EGo v1.4.1 (8b99356398dd3bcb5f74e5194d20ce421f607404)
    ERROR: open hello: no such file or directory
    ```

*   [This Dockerfile in step 2.4](https://github.com/wetee-dao/examples/blob/main/README.md#12-add-golang-maingo) try to add the app.manifest and the [script/build_docker.sh](https://github.com/wetee-dao/examples/blob/main/gramine-template/script/build_docker.sh#L11) deletes this file. I needed to remove the `ADD app.manifest` from the Dockerfile.

    ```
    azureuser@weteevm:~/examples/my-gramine-app$ sh script/build_docker.sh
    rm: cannot remove 'app.manifest': No such file or directory
    rm: cannot remove 'app.manifest.sgx': No such file or directory
    rm: cannot remove 'app.sig': No such file or directory
    script/build_docker.sh: 15: gramine-manifest: not found
    DEPRECATED: The legacy builder is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
                Install the buildx component to build images with BuildKit:
                https://docs.docker.com/go/buildx/
    Sending build context to Docker daemon  3.944MB
    Step 1/6 : FROM wetee/gramine-ubuntu:20.04
    ---> c8112cf922d4

    ---> b1ea2b49a2d9
    Step 3/6 : ADD app.manifest /
    ADD failed: file not found in build context or excluded by .dockerignore: stat app.manifest: file does not exist
    ```

### Manual Tests

I followed [this guide](https://github.com/wetee-dao/chain/blob/patch/docs/grants/milestone-2-documentation.md) to test. The test didn't have any problem. One doubt, is it expected to finalize the task a few blocks after [its creation](https://github.com/wetee-dao/chain/blob/patch/docs/grants/milestone-2-documentation.md)?

![image (56)](https://github.com/dsm-w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/assets/112647953/8fd70d53-58cc-48a8-8e25-36e2d528a4ff)

If this is expected, would be nice to have a task example that takes longer to finalize.

### Atomated Tests

I'm in doubt about why the command in the instructions clones the `integritee-network/worker`. Could you explain how the two projects are related?

```
git clone  https://github.com/integritee-network/worker && cd worker
go test ./...
```

Anyway, I ran the tests on the [wetee-dao/worker repository](https://github.com/wetee-dao/worker) because I think it should be the correct repository. All tests passed but the coverage could be better. Improve the coverage it isn't mandatory.

```
azureuser@weteevm:~/worker$ go test ./... -coverprofile=c.out
    wetee.app/worker   	 coverage: 0.0% of statements
    wetee.app/worker/api/v1   	 coverage: 0.0% of statements

ok 	wetee.app/worker/util    0.010s    coverage: 60.0% of statements
```

### App example

The examples work, but the [ego-http-server](https://github.com/wetee-dao/examples/tree/main/ego-http-server) needs instructions to build the hello.go. 

The examples could have a better explanation about them on the Readme.md. 

Can you explain where are the C, C++ and Python examples?
