**The [invoice form :pencil:](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmNYaoCgrxyhzgoKQ0ynQvnNRoTmgApz9NrMp-hd8mhIiO0A/viewform) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/Support%20Docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** <https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/TuxedoDapp.md>
* **Milestone Number:** 2

**Context**

Unlike traditional account-based systems, UTXO-based systems treat each transaction output as a distinct entity, introducing advantages in parallel processing and state transition simplicity. The Tuxedo project endeavours to demonstrate the flexibility and interoperability of Polkadot by implementing UTXO as one of its paradigms. MLabs, with expertise in the Cardano ecosystem utilizing UTXO as its core model, sees an opportunity to contribute to Tuxedo's success, address identified issues, and engage in future collaborative activities.

Our goal is to showcase the potentiality of a real business case of UTXO paradigm on Polkadot.

In this conclusive milestone of the project, we will demo the overall solution with every single component we built (frontend, web service,  swagger restful API contracts and the CLI-wallet extended). We will include our comments on how this product could have been built by adopting an EVM-based chain and also another UTXO-based chain backed by smart contracts.

For the same purposes, users could also use the CLI-wallet we extended. |
| **0g.** | Personalized Dashboard | Video showed at 0d | A personal dashboard for users to view and manage their NFT-based kitty collections. Display detailed information about each NFT, including ownership and other details such as parents, dna, Tradable status, Price, etc |


##

**Additional Information**

We did a [short comparative analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kdYA9Jd100p91t9okjYncLZw_Qn6guo2Bm032mko3DU/edit?usp=sharing) of the development of the same application adopting EVM-based and Cardano (eUTXO) versus Tuxedo.
Moreover, it underscores the potential for Tuxedo's ongoing development to become a robust platform for creating UTXO Dapps on Polkadot.
