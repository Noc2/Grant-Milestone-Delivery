**Context**
We are delivering the: **Toolchain: implement relayer and WASM bindings for zero-knowledge gadgets, types API, dApp integration** milestone from the Webb extended mixer deliverable.

This delivery includes the webb-dapp w/ designs, the webb.js SDK, the webb private transaction relayer, and the protocol-substrate pallets from milestone 1.

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work. 
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.
