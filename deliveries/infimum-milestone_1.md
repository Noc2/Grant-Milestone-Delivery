**The delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/Support%20Docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/infimum.md
* **Milestone Number:** 1

**Context** (optional)
The Infimum project is intended to provide a private, receipt-free, and verifiable voting apparatus which disincentivizes collusion between participants. The current goal is to produce a proof-of-concept and not something that should be immediately used in production (however, in the future, we would like for that to be the case). 

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work. 
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.

**Additional Information**
> Any further comments on the milestone that you would like to share with us.

There is an effort currently beginning to help provide a more generic interface to the pallet, e.g. with respect to things such as extrinsics and the data layout, which differs slightly from the one explicitly laid out in the original proposal. This however does not deviate from the goals state therein, and instead is intended to provide developers a richer surface area with which they are able to customize their integration of the pallet.
