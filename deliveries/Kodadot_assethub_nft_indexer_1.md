**Additional Information**

Validity of the delivery has been checked by the [Squid Integrity checker that we wrote](https://github.com/vikiival/squidtegrity) for this purpose. The delivery is valid.
And we have not found any unknown deviations from the "test" FireSquid that we wrote as Proof of Concept.

As a runner setup we highly recommend to use [casey/just](https://github.com/casey/just) to run the indexer.
