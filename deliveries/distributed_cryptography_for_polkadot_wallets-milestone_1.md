# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:


**The delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/Support%20Docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** [Distributed Cryptography for Polkadot Wallets](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/distributed_cryptography_for_polkadot_wallets.md)
* **Milestone Number:** 1

**Context** (optional)

In this milestone we deliver a report on state-of-the-art threshold Schnorr signature schemes. We evaluate them on the basis of a number of properties, which we also define in the report.
The purpose of this report is to support a decision on the choice of signature scheme we use to construct the wallet in the upcoming milestones.

**Additional Information**

The linked report evaluates the diffenrent signature schemes with respect to a number of properties. In the end, we narrow our choices down to three different schemes, which provide tradeoffs for different evaluation criteria. We encourage the community and reviewers to participate in the decision-making process through [github issues in the same repository](https://github.com/perun-network/polkadot-wallet-grant/issues).
