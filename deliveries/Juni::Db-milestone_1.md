## Additional Information

During the development process, we have understood that @mmagician caution was right and itâ€™s not an easy part of work to update offchain::ipfs to the latest substrate version. This was the cause of our delay in the delivery of the first milestone. We have implemented the first version of JuniDB for Substrate 2.x and want to upgrade it (with whole offchain:ipfs) in our new milestone which one we want to do as our second milestone and prepare new PR for the approval.
