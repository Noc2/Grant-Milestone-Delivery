* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/xcmsend.md
* **Milestone Number:** 1

**Context**    
XCMSend makes it a lot easier for anyone to build transactions flow by utilizing XCM. In our application we promised to deliver Rococo support, after researching and reaching out to several Roc connected chains we continously experienced problems with Rococo. So we decided to support Polkadot connected chains instead.
