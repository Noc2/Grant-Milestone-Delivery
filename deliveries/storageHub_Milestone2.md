# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

**The delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/Support%20Docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/StorageHub.md 
* **Milestone Number:** 2

**Context** 

StorageHub is a decentralized storage system parachain optimized for file-based storage and larger data sets that are not suitable to be stored directly in standard parachain storageunsuitable for direct storage in standard parachain systems. The proposed parachain will provide developers in the Polkadot ecosystem with an alternate decentralized and substrate-based storage solution and functionality.

The two main deliverables for the second milestone include the attached [article](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/storagehub-looking-ahead/5313), which presents a comprehensive technical design of StorageHub, and the [proof of concept](https://github.com/Moonsong-Labs/storage-hub-runtime-poc) that illustrates a simplistic execution flow of StorageHub.
