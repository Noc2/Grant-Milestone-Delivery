# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

**The [invoice form :pencil:](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmNYaoCgrxyhzgoKQ0ynQvnNRoTmgApz9NrMp-hd8mhIiO0A/viewform) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/Support%20Docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** [FiDi DotSight](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/fidi-dotsight-analytics.md)
* **Milestone Number:** 2

**Progress**
* We have successfully evolved the user interface into an intuitive, code-free analytical platform, consistent with the strategic direction set forth in our [prior milestone](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/1080#issuecomment-1881517430).
* This marks the completion of the final milestone for [FiDi DotSight](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/fidi-dotsight-analytics.md). Milestones [1](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/fidi-dotsight-milestone-1.md) and [3](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/fidi-dotsight-milestone-3.md) have been previously delivered and milestone [4](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/2258) has been proposed out of scope.

 In surpassing our initial goals, we have accomplished the following:
* Enabled access to DotLake data within FiDi, thanks to the collaborative efforts and contributions of the Parity Data Platform team.
* Integrated additional key data sources, including Chainlink, DappRadar, Public BigQuery, Subsquid, DeBank, and Ankr.
* Achieved parachain-level data coverage via BigQuery and DotLake resources.

**Available Use Cases**
* Top-level Polkadot metrics: Monthly Active, Transactions, Unique Addresses (Network > Polkadot).
* Governance Analytics (Network > Polkadot > Treasury Balance).
* Wallet-Level Analytics: (Wallets > One or Many > Net Worth, Holdings, NFTs).
* Combined EVM and non-EVM analytics (e.g., Network > Polakdot, Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum > All Metrics).
* Real-Time Pricing Data (Token > One or Many > Price).
* Block Production for EVM (Network > One or Many > Block Production).


**Key Links**
* As before, the backend and frontend are available in [fidi-tech/dotsight](https://github.com/fidi-tech/dotsight) and [fidi-tech/dotsight-ui](https://github.com/fidi-tech/dotsight-ui) respective repositories.
* The current iteration of the platform is live at [dot.fidi.tech/v2](https://dot.fidi.tech/v2).
* The documentation is available at [docs.fidi.tech](https://docs.fidi.tech/) and is actively evolving.

**Next Steps**
* Our target launch date within the Polkadot community is tentatively set for April 10th. Leading up to the launch, weâ€™re focusing on adding more finesse to user experience, closing gaps in the parachain coverage, and introducing more dashboard types.
* Additionally, we will be proposing a Decentralized Future initiative aimed at further advancing FiDi's capabilities to a fully-fledged self-serviced analytics portal for Polkadot, i.e., encompassing a broader array of metrics, dashboard types, data sources, advanced querying, external embedding capabilities, and a creator UI for arranging widgets accoridng to user preference.
